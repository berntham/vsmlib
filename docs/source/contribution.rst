Contribution Guide
==================

This is a guide for all contributions to vsmlib.
The development of vsmlib is running on `the official repository at GitHub <https://github.com/undertherain/vsmlib>`_.

Some quick notes:
-----------------

Please send pull requests to the ``master`` branch.

If you send pull request, please make sure your code is pep8-compliant

If you want to raise an ussue, please first do a quick search to see if it has already been reported. If so, it's often better to just leave a comment on an existing issue, rather than creating a new one.

Issues are for bug reports, feature requests etc. For usage-related question please use other channels. 

If you can write code to fix an issue, we encourage to send a PR.

If you code adds new functionality - unit test would be awesome.
