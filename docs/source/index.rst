vsmlib - Python library for vector space models
===============================================

VSMlib is an open-source Python library for working with vector space models (VSMs), 
including various word embeddings such as word2vec. VSMlib can load various popular 
formats of VSMs and perform a set of basic operations like dimensionality reduction, seach for nearest neighbors etc. It includes a growing 
list of benchmarks with which VSMs are evaluated in most current research, and a few visualization tools. 
It also includes a growing list of modules for creating VSMs, both explicit and based on neural networks.
